trafficLight_classification

If you want to run this trafficLight_classification, you can run "colorful.ipynb".
It is the latest version. This has timecode and functions following real time and classify the main traffic light or sub one.

Colorful.ipynb
   red: red traffic light
 green: green traffic light
  blue: car traffic light
  gray: others(noise)
   sub: traffic light (size isn't the biggest in the pic)
 
speedy.ipynb
 this is my first version, which needs the directories.
 ~directories~
  rectangle: cropped traffic light images
red & green: extract red or green color from images in rectangle

direct.ipynb
 this is my second version, which doesn't need directories.
 But this shows only one class(traffic light).
